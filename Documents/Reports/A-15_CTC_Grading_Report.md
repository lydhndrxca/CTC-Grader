## Subgrade Breakdown
| Category | Score | Weight | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| Geometry | 8.5 | 30% | Overall shape and proportions |
| Corners | 7.5 | 20% | Corner radius and sharpness |
| Coating | 8 | 12% | Surface coating quality |
| Surface | 8 | 20% | Texture and finish |
| Alignment | 8.5 | 18% | Edge alignment and symmetry |

## Detailed Interpretation
The specimen shows a generally good shape with slight asymmetry, leading to a geometry subgrade of 8.5. The corners exhibit noticeable wear and rounding, capping the corners subgrade at 7.5. The coating is fairly consistent but has some uneven areas, resulting in an 8.0. The surface texture is mostly smooth with minor defects, earning an 8.0. Edge alignment is relatively good, with minor deviations, leading to an 8.5. Overall, the piece is in good condition with moderate wear.

## Framework Application
This specimen was graded using v1.5 Strict++ standards, applying strict deductive grading principles with no rounding up and additive flaw penalties.
