## Subgrade Breakdown
| Category | Score | Weight | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| Geometry | 8 | 30% | Overall shape and proportions |
| Corners | 7.5 | 20% | Corner radius and sharpness |
| Coating | 8.5 | 12% | Surface coating quality |
| Surface | 8 | 20% | Texture and finish |
| Alignment | 8 | 18% | Edge alignment and symmetry |

## Detailed Interpretation
The specimen shows a generally good shape but with some irregularities in geometry. The corners exhibit noticeable wear and rounding, which affects the overall corner grade. The coating is fairly consistent, though not perfect, with some areas appearing slightly uneven. The surface texture is typical but has minor defects and inconsistencies. Edge alignment is decent but not perfectly symmetrical. Overall, the piece is in good condition with moderate wear, leading to a grade of PSA 8.0.

## Framework Application
This specimen was graded using v1.5 Strict++ standards, applying strict deductive grading principles with no rounding up and additive flaw penalties.
