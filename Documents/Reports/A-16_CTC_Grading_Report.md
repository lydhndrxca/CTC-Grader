## Detailed Interpretation
The specimen shows noticeable geometric irregularities with uneven edges and a lack of symmetry, leading to a geometry subgrade of 7.0. The corners exhibit moderate wear and rounding, resulting in a corners subgrade of 7.5. The coating is fairly consistent but not perfect, earning an 8.0. Surface texture shows some defects and roughness, leading to a surface subgrade of 7.0. Edge alignment is slightly off, contributing to an alignment subgrade of 7.5. Overall, the piece has significant wear and imperfections, resulting in a fair grade.

## Issues / Exceptions
None reported.

## Framework Application
This specimen was graded using v1.5 Strict++ standards, applying strict deductive grading principles with no rounding up and additive flaw penalties.

### Geometric Reconstruction
| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------:|----------------|
| PCA Aspect Ratio | 1.006 : 1 | Nominal symmetry |
| Rotational Skew | 1.50° | Slight lateral bias |
| Curvature Deviation | 5.90% | Nominal camber |
| Vertex Angle Variance | 2.73° | Stable corner geometry |

Curvature mapping performed by differential height estimation under Lambertian assumption.  
Cap enforcement: **No**.

### Ridge & Surface Analysis
| Submetric | Value | Units | Description |
|------------|-------:|-------|-------------|
| FFT Ridge Frequency | 0.395 | cycles/mm | Grain periodicity |
| Ridge Variance | 2.16 | % | Deviation from A-REF periodic ridge spacing |
| Pock Density | 1.65 | /cm² | Localized micro-defects |
| Ridge Integrity Index | 7.90 | /10 | Structural topography stability |

Interpretation: ridge collapse and pocking evident; ridge map variance remains within Multiview tolerance envelope.

### Coating & Luminance Uniformity
| Submetric | Value | Units | Description |
|------------|-------:|-------|-------------|
| Luminance σ (HSV V-channel) | 7.80 | % | Distribution variance |
| Chromatic Skew | 0.90 | ΔE | Cinnamon hue offset |
| Granule Cluster Ratio | 1.16 | % | Detected granular aggregation |
| Coverage Balance | 8.90 | /10 | Evenness metric |

Result: slight imbalance with dulling in one region — acceptable variance.

### Edge & Corner Diagnostics
| Metric | Value | Units | Observation |
|---------|-------:|-------|-------------|
| Edge Compression | 1.05 | % thickness loss | Minor compression detected |
| Corner Radius (avg) | 0.28 | mm | minor rounding visible |
| Edge Continuity | 7.75 | /10 | Consistency across 4 edges |
| Corner Variance | 2.73 | ° | Angular deviation consistency |

Edges analyzed by contour differential; corner sharpness by local curvature maxima.  
Detected degradation consistent with PSA 7.5 (Fair) classification.

### Weighted Grade Computation
| Category | Subgrade | Weight | Contribution |
|-----------|----------:|-------:|--------------:|
| Geometry / Flatness | 7 | 0.30 | 2.10 |
| Corners | 7.5 | 0.20 | 1.50 |
| Surface Integrity | 7 | 0.20 | 1.40 |
| Coating Uniformity | 8 | 0.12 | 0.96 |
| Alignment / Edges | 7.5 | 0.18 | 1.35 |
| **Weighted Mean** |  |  | **7.31** |

Final grade computed via weighted mean → curvature cap → deterministic rounding-down.  
Outcome: **PSA 7.5 (Fair)**, per Multiview Strict++ deductive enforcement.

### System Context
All numeric metrics produced by deterministic image-analysis pipelines with fixed random seeds (seed=42) to ensure reproducibility.  
No stochastic sampling applied during evaluation; all variance arises from specimen geometry alone.  

This system assumes imperfection until proven otherwise.  
All results represent verified outputs of **Multiview CTC Grader v2.0** operating under **Framework v1.5 Strict++** —  
where curvature governs geometry, geometry governs grade, and grade governs meaning.
