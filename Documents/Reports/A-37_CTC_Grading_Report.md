# MULTIVIEW TECHNOLOGY  
## OFFICIAL CINNAMON TOAST CRUNCH GRADING REPORT

*“Why not take the most ordinary thing and bury it in paperwork until it feels important?”*

---

### **Specimen Identification**
**Specimen ID:** A-37  
**Certification ID:**   
**Classification:** VO  
**Framework:** Multiview Grading Standards v1.6  
**Date:** 10/13/2025  
**Time:** 4:11:25 PM  
**Certified By:** Shawn Wiederhoeft  

---

### **Measurements & Weight**
**Length × Width × Thickness:** not recorded mm  
**Weight:** not recorded g  

If no measurements provided → *“Measurements not recorded (Visual-Only grade)”*

---

### **Condition Summary**
The specimen exhibits a significant curvature of approximately 10%, which is outside the ideal 2-5% range, resulting in a penalty. The geometry is affected by this warp, leading to a lower subgrade. Corners show moderate wear but maintain a reasonable shape. The coating is consistent, with a good distribution of cinnamon and sugar. The surface texture is generally smooth with minor defects. Edge alignment is decent but not perfect, contributing to the overall grade cap of 8.0.

### **Personal / Observational Note**


---

### **Interpretation**
This specimen was evaluated under **Multiview Grading Standards v1.6**, applying full strict-mode enforcement and curvature cap logic.  
Any subgrade < 8.0 or curvature > 7.5 % automatically invoked the grade cap of ≤ 8.0.  
Rounding applied deterministically downward.

## **Appendix — Understanding the Report**

### **How to Read This Report**
- **Subgrades (0–10):** Corners = edge integrity, Edges = cracks/uniformity, Surface = ridge clarity, Coating = granule balance, Geometry = flatness + aspect ratio.  
- **Measurements:** Recorded in mm/g using calipers and digital scale.  
- **Curvature:** Max height deviation ÷ half-span × 100 %.  
- **PSA Scale:** 10 = Gem Mint → 1 = Poor (broken or burned).  
- **Strict-Mode:** Any uncertainty reduces grade; never rounds up.

### **About Multiview Technology**
Multiview Technology is a conceptual grading authority that applies forensic-level analysis to disposable breakfast objects.  
Each specimen passes through an AI-assisted vision pipeline measuring geometry, curvature, color variance, and ridge frequency.  
Results are deterministic, weighted, and rounded conservatively to enforce discipline in absurdity.  

*The paperwork is real. The subject is breakfast.*

---

### **Archival Policy**
Every document—complete or erroneous—is permanently preserved for provenance continuity.  
Error or incomplete grades are recorded with the same status as valid reports.

## System Hash & Provenance Record  
**Multiview Digital Integrity Hash (SHA-256):** c913d333…e447cf14  
*(Full hash stored in archive metadata)*  

**Generated:** 2025-10-13T21:11:26.013Z  
**System:** Multiview CTC Grader v2.0 • Framework v1.6  
**Seed:** 42  
**Verification Type:** VO  

This cryptographic digest links the specimen’s imagery, analysis, and report into a single verifiable record.  
Tampering with any source file will invalidate the hash upon re-verification.  
A complete copy of the digest is archived within Multiview’s internal ledger for future audit.
