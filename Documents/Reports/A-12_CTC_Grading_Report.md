| Surface | 7 | 20% | Texture and finish |
| Alignment | 7.5 | 18% | Edge alignment and symmetry |

## Detailed Interpretation
The specimen shows noticeable geometric irregularities with uneven edges and a lack of symmetry, leading to a geometry subgrade of 7.0. The corners are worn and not well-defined, resulting in a corners subgrade of 7.5. The coating is fairly consistent but has some uneven patches, earning an 8.0. The surface texture is rough with visible defects, contributing to a surface subgrade of 7.0. Edge alignment is slightly off, leading to an alignment subgrade of 7.5. Overall, the piece exhibits significant wear and imperfections, resulting in a fair grade.

## Framework Application
This specimen was graded using v1.5 Strict++ standards, applying strict deductive grading principles with no rounding up and additive flaw penalties.
