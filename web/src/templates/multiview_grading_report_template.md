### **Personal / Observational Note**
{{personal_note}}

---

### **Interpretation**
This specimen was evaluated under **Multiview Grading Standards {{framework}}**, applying full strict-mode enforcement and curvature cap logic.  
Any subgrade < 8.0 or curvature > 7.5 % automatically invoked the grade cap of ≤ 8.0.  
Rounding applied deterministically downward.

## **Appendix — Understanding the Report**

### **How to Read This Report**
- **Subgrades (0–10):** Corners = edge integrity, Edges = cracks/uniformity, Surface = ridge clarity, Coating = granule balance, Geometry = flatness + aspect ratio.  
- **Measurements:** Recorded in mm/g using calipers and digital scale.  
- **Curvature:** Max height deviation ÷ half-span × 100 %.  
- **PSA Scale:** 10 = Gem Mint → 1 = Poor (broken or burned).  
- **Strict-Mode:** Any uncertainty reduces grade; never rounds up.

### **About Multiview Technology**
Multiview Technology is a conceptual grading authority that applies forensic-level analysis to disposable breakfast objects.  
Each specimen passes through an AI-assisted vision pipeline measuring geometry, curvature, color variance, and ridge frequency.  
Results are deterministic, weighted, and rounded conservatively to enforce discipline in absurdity.  

*The paperwork is real. The subject is breakfast.*

---

### **Archival Policy**
Every document—complete or erroneous—is permanently preserved for provenance continuity.  
Error or incomplete grades are recorded with the same status as valid reports.
